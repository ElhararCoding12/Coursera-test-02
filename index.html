		<p>This is the BEST guacamole dish  it’s nice and simple to make and used fresh, high quality ingredients. Authentic guacamole doesn’t contain fillers and unnecessary ingredients. All we use is avocados, onion, tomatoes, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, lime juice, garlic and salt. Easy and delicious!

			So how do we pick good, ripe avocados? First, we grab avocados that still have the stem attached. If the stem has been removed in the store, it’s more likely to have brown spots on the inside. Then, gently press on one end. It should be firm, but have a slight give to it.

			How do we make Guacamole we slice three ripe avocados in half, remove the pit and scoop them into a mixing bowl. Then use a fork to gently mash them to your desired level of chunky or smooth. Add the onions, tomatoes, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, garlic, lime juice and salt and stir everything together. That’s it. The most delicious, easy guacamole.
