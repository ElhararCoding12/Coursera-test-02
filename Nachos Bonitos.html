		<p>
			Traditional nachos consist of the tortilla chips topped with cheese and jalapeños, as done by Anaya. The modern form of nachos has several possible ingredients with the most common toppings being cheese, guacamole, salsa, sour cream, jalapeños, olives, refried beans, ground beef, chicken, and sometimes lettuce.

			Nachos were invented in Mexico, for Americans, by a Mexican! They originated in the small Mexican town of Piedras Negras in 1943 and were invented by restaurateur, Ignacio “Nacho” Anaya. One day, when Nacho was without his chef, he needed to rustle up a quick snack for a group of US military wives who were in town
			
		</p>
		<p>
			The dish became an essential part of the Victory Club menu, and a fixture on others in the region. Eventually, Mr. Anaya moved to Eagle Pass and opened a restaurant called Nacho's. “Nachos were created in a restaurant of mainly comida casera, the foods that Mexican-American families were eating at the time,”
